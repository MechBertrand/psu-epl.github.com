E.P.L. managers get 24 card key access to the E.P.L., which is fun. However, there are responsibilities that come with the position, and some hoops to jump through. Here's what you need to know:

- A manager's most important responsibility is to keep the people and equipment safe.
- After safety, the next responsibility is to train other people on the equipment during their open lab time. This means managers must be good with people, like teaching, and of course understand all of the equipment enough to be able to teach others how to use it.  This means that managers will have to be constantly using the equipment and going through the S.O.P's to get a good feel for the equipment, as a manager you will be expected to know the equipment and be able to train others without much assistance. 
- Managers are also expected to improve the lab as they can. Improving SOPs, building new tools using our equipment, or something to improve the place or processes for the lab.
- Managers must put in at least 2 hours per week of open E.P.L. time. Usually, this means a single 2-hour block of time each week, but we're flexible.
- Volunteer managers will be asked to do a term or multi-term project to upgrade the lab.  These projects will help the managers understand more and also have some distinguishable "thing" that they worked on while working in the lab. This term project, while mandatory, will encumber about 1 hour per week at most.  
- As a manager, you will constantly be introducing the lab to new people, and even be asked to give a short presentation on the lab (< 5 min) for tour groups that often come through the E.P.L.

Here's how becoming a manager works:

1. You will need to send an email to the current E.P.L. administrator (currently Chris) at lid@pdx.edu establishing yourself as a candidate for manager.  This email should include a little info about yourself.  The lab admin will then send you an application to fill out.  The date that the application is filled out will be your start date.  

2. You need to be trained on all of the equipment that's currently being used in the lab. You will also need to be trained in all of the store operations. You have approximately 30 days from your application date to train on all of the equipment.  

2. The admin will email the current manager group and let everyone know you're about to become a new manager. Any current manager can veto someone trying to become a manager. This may sound arbitrary, but it's not: it's specifically to prevent people who aren't good with other people or with equipment from becoming managers. Becoming a manager is a big responsibility and means keeping people safe, being responsible, and contributing to the community. Some people just aren't ready for that yet.

3. Finally, once all this happens, the admin will meet with you and go over becoming a manager (takes about an hour).

4. After 6 months you can apply to become a paid manager.  The instructions to do this are here: [Getting Paid](https://github.com/psu-epl/epl-managers-private/wiki/Getting-paid-as-a-Student-Manager)
