L.I.D. managers get 24 card key access to the L.I.D., which is fun. However, there's responsibilities that come with the position, and some hoops to jump through. Here's what you need to know:

- Managers must put in at least 2 hours per week of open L.I.D. time. Usually this means a single 2 hour block of time each week, but we're flexible.
- A manager's most important responsibility is to keep the people and equipment safe.
- After safety, the next responsibility is to train other people on the equipment during their open lab time. This means managers must be good with people, like teaching, and of course understand all of the equipment enough to be able to teach others how to use it.
- Managers are also expected to improve the lab as they can. Improving SOPs, building new tools using our equipment, or something to improve the place or processes for the lab.
- As a manager you will constantly be introducing the lab to new people, and even be asked to give a short presentation on the lab (< 5 min) for tour groups that often come through the L.I.D.

Here's how becoming a manager works:

1. You need to be trained on all of the equipment that's currently being used in the lab. For example, everything but the A406 router as of 2014/06/01.

2. You need to get 3 current managers to sponsor you to become a manager. They will have to send the L.I.D. administrator (currently Chris) an email saying that they support you becoming a manager.

3. The admin will email the current manager group and let everyone know you're about to become a new manager. Any current manager can veto someone trying to become a manager. This may sound arbitrary, but it's not: it's specifically to prevent people who aren't good with other people or with equipment from becoming managers. Becoming a manager is a big responsibility and means keeping people safe, being responsible, and contributing to the community. Some people just aren't ready for that yet.

4. Finally, once all this happens, the admin will meet with you and go over becoming a manager (takes about an hour).
