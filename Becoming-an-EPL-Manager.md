EPL managers get 24 card key access to the EPL, which is fun. However, there's responsibilities that come with the position, and some hoops to jump through. Here's what you need to know:

- Managers must put in > 1 hour per week of open EPL time. Usually this means a single 2 hour block of time each week, but we're flexible.
- A manager's most important responsibility is to keep the people and equipment safe.
- After safety, the next responsibility is to train other people on the equipment during their open lab time. This means managers must be good with people, like teaching, and of course understand all of the equipment enough to be able to teach others how to use it.

Here's how becoming a manager works:

1. You need to be trained on all of the equipment that's currently being used in the lab. For example, everything but the A406 router as of 2014/06/01.

2. You need to get 3 current managers to sponsor you to become a manager. They will have to send the EPL administrator (currently Andrew) an email saying that they support you becoming a manager.

3. The admin will email the current manager group and let everyone know you're about to become a new manager. Any current manager can veto someone trying to become a manager. This may sound arbitrary, but it's not: it's specifically to prevent people who aren't good with other people or with equipment from becoming managers. Becoming a manager is a big responsibility and means contributing to the community, and some people simply aren't ready for that yet.

4. Finally, once all this happens, the admin will meet with you and go over becoming a manager (takes about an hour).
