Objectives:

* Learn how to use:
    * Function Generator
    * DMM
    * Oscilloscope
    * Power Supply
* Using these Devices you will learn about:
    * Differential measurements
    * Continuity
    * Diode Test
    * Impedance
    * XY Mode
    * FFT Spectrum
* Circuits will be provided for this lab and instructor will give detailed instructions on how and where to take measurements.  

Outcome:  You will understand the measurements you can take and how they are useful.  You will also know why some measurements are informative but may be flawed.
