# Portland State University Electronics Prototyping Laboratory

The EPL is a lab for rapidly prototyping *electronics* projects. It is meant for students (and eventually community members) to be able to walk in with an idea and CAD files and walk out with a fully functioning piece of electronics in an enclosure.
