# Portland State University Electronics Prototyping Laboratory

**What:** The EPL is a lab for rapidly prototyping *electronics* projects. It is meant for students (and eventually community members) to be able to walk in with an idea and CAD files and walk out with a fully functioning piece of electronics in an enclosure.

**Where:** We're located in room 60-10 in the basement of PSU's Fourth Avenue Building ("FAB", 1900 SW 4th Avenue).

**Who:** We're only open to PSU MCECS students and professors right now, but we're actively looking for community mentors as well. We're trying to open to community members by this summer.

## Use of the Lab

### Normal everyday lab users

1. Check out our [[schedule|http://psu-epl.github.com]] and come in during any office hour for training.
1. Sign the waiver form.
1. Get yourself trained on a piece of equipment.
1. Come in and use the equipment whenever an EPL Manager has office hours.
1. Go to (3).

### Becoming a lab manager

1. Get trained on **all** the equipment.
1. Get three current managers to sponsor you.
1. Ask the EPL Administrators to become a manager. Sorry, we can't guarantee that you will definitely become a manager, but we'll try to make it work!
1. Once you're stamped with approval: Get a Github account, get logins on the EPL PCs, get on the mailing list, get on the shared google calendar, swear to the oath of fealty (Kidding!) and get trained on manager SOPs.
1. Put in weekly office hours (we're serious about this: if you're an EPL manager, part of the deal is that you put in office hours).
