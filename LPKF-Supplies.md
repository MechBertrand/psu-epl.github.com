Info on things to order for the LPKF S63 PCB router.

# BITS!!

NOTE: When ordering bits from [Think and Tinker](http://precisebits.com/), **please be SURE to select "Ringed" and let them know in the order it should be ringed for the LPKF S63**.

## Isolation bits ("Universal cutters")

We tried T&T cutter bits, but it didn't work well on the LPKF. So we purchase directly through LPKF.

- **0.1 mm microcutter**
   - [Part #: 100890-4 "Milling Bit .01 - 0.15 mm (4-6 mil) w/ orange ring"](http://www.lpkfusa.com/Store/pages/ProductDetail.aspx?cat=11%2f43&cid=43&pid=211)
   - Fine Line Tool/Micro Cutter is used for milling printed circuit board isolation tracks of 4 - 6 mils. 100% Carbide, 60 degree tip, 1.42" (36 mm) overall length. Orange Distance Rings included.
   - Price: $215.00, 10 per pack 
- **0.2 mm universal cutter**
   - [Part #: 101010-4 "Milling Bit 0.2 - 0.3 mm (8-12 mil) w/ orange ring"](http://www.lpkfusa.com/Store/pages/ProductDetail.aspx?cat=11%2f43&cid=43&pid=210)
   - Universal Milling Tool is used for milling printed circuit board isolation tracks of 8 - 12 mils. 100% Carbide, 90 degree tip, 1.42" (36 mm) overall length. Orange Distance Rings included.
   - Price: $185.00, 10 per pack


## Drills ("Spiral drills")

* Get every other 0.1 mm value. Fewer parts to stock, and practically speaking, being off by 0.0039" never matters.

* DC208-M035-023D - 0.35 mm (for Nystrom vias)
* DC208-M040-023D - 0.40 mm drill
* DC208-M050-036D - 0.50 mm drill

* MN208-0313-005F - 0.8 mm stub end mill
* MN208-0394-008F - 1mm stub end mill
* MN208-0787-020F - 2mm stub end mill
* MN208-1181-022F - 3mm stub end mill (Note: not in the LPKF starter kit)

# Misc

- The LPKF starter kit also has "1.0 mm (39 mil) Long End Mill" and "2.0 mm (79 mil) Long End Mill". This is for "pocket routing", their weird 2.5D routing thing. We can ignore these, since we're just doing PCBs.
- The cutter bits we tried were the:
   - EM2E8-0625-60VC - 60 degree ZrN coated 2-flute engraving bit (cuts deeper, better for some substrates/designs): recommended for "universal cutter" replacement
   - EM2E8-0625-90VC - 90 degree ZrN coated 2-flute engraving bit, alternative
