Info on things to order for the LPKF S63 PCB router.

# BITS!!

When ordering bits from [Think and Tinker](http://precisebits.com/), **please be SURE to select "Ringed" and let them know in the order it should be ringed for the LPKF S63**.

## Isolation bits ("Universal cutters")

LPKF has a "0.1 mm microcutter" and a "0.2 mm universal cutter". Both of these are simply engraving bits.

* EM2E8-0625-60VC - 60 degree ZrN coated 2-flute engraving bit (cuts deeper, better for some substrates/designs): recommended for "universal cutter" replacement
* EM2E8-0625-90VC - 90 degree ZrN coated 2-flute engraving bit, alternative


## Drills ("Spiral drills")

* Get every other 0.1 mm value. Fewer parts to stock, and practically speaking, being off by 0.0039" never matters.

* DC208-M035-023D - 0.35 mm (for Nystrom vias)
* DC208-M040-023D - 0.40 mm drill
* DC208-M050-036D - 0.50 mm drill
* DC208-M060-034D - 0.60 mm drill
* DC208-M070-040D - 0.70 mm drill
* DC208-M080-040D - 0.80 mm drill
* DC208-M090-040D - 0.90 mm drill
* DC208-M100-040D - 1.00 mm drill
* DC208-M110-040D - 1.10 mm drill
* DC208-M120-040D - 1.20 mm drill
* DC208-M130-040D - 1.30 mm drill
* DC208-M140-040D - 1.40 mm drill
* DC208-M150-040D - 1.50 mm drill
* DC208-M160-040D - 1.60 mm drill
* DC208-M170-040D - 1.70 mm drill
* DC208-M190-040D - 1.90 mm drill
* DC208-M180-040D - 1.80 mm drill
* DC208-M200-040D - 2.00 mm drill
* DC208-M300-040D - 3.00 mm drill

## Router bits ("Contour routers")

* Link: <http://precisebits.com/products/carbidebits/fcrouter.asp>
* RCC08-0394-026F - 1mm fish-tail chip breaker
* RCC08-0787-032F - 2mm fish-tail chip breaker

## End Mills

* Link: <http://precisebits.com/products/carbidebits/precisebit-stub.asp>
* MN208-0313-005F - 0.8 mm stub end mill
* MN208-0394-008F - 1mm stub end mill
* MN208-0787-020F - 2mm stub end mill
* MN208-1181-022F - 3mm stub end mill (Note: not in the LPKF starter kit)

Note that the LPKF starter kit also has "1.0 mm (39 mil) Long End Mill" and "2.0 mm (79 mil) Long End Mill". This is for "pocket routing", their weird 2.5D routing thing. We can ignore these, since we're really just doing PCBs.
