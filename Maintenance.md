# Changing a bit

- TBD
- Put the used bit in the "bad tool" area or throw it out.
- Email the managers list if we get low on that particular tool.

# Maintaining the tool clamp

- Under Help > Help, search for clamp, choose tool clamp maintanence, and watch the video.
- Turn the LPKF and start.
- Edit > Tool Magazine and clear the tool collet of any tool.
   - Click on the cross hair to put away any tool in the collet
   - The head should end up off the board in back (the "idle" position)
- Squeeze off the plastic depth shroud.
- Use cylindrical collet removal tool to unscrew and remove the collet.
- Use the white cleaning tool  to clean out the collet chuck (in the head). Twist it in and out to get in the chuck all the way.
- Under the microscope, use the micro-bottle brush to clean all the gunk out of the collet, both the hole and the slots.
- Clean the white cleaning tool as best you can. Don't get it wet, just wipe it off.
- Put the tiniest dab of lubricate on the white thingy.
  - DO NOT PUT THE LUBRICANT GET ANY WHERE NEAR THE SLITS.
  - Dab the lubricant on the outside shoulder of the collet. 
  - Carefully smooth out the dabs of lubricant on the shoulders into a thin film.
- Put the collet back in, screwing it in finger tight.
- Slip in a tool into the collet, make sure it slides in easily and falls right out. It should be a smooth, mostly frictionless fit.
- You're good to go!
