# Info on the EPL for PSU Professors

- As a professor, do I get automatic access to the lab?
   - Because you can kill, maim, or hurt anyone just like everyone else, you MUST be trained on the equipment in order to use it. Let us explicitly yell a little bit here:  EVEN IF YOU HAVE CARD ACCESS TO THE LAB, YOU MAY NOT USE THE EQUIPMENT UNTIL YOU ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. FURTHER, YOU MAY NOT BE IN THE EPL ALONE UNLESS YOU ARE AN EPL MANAGER. Thanks for understanding this.
- Can I get trained on the equipment?
   - Heck yes! Just check out our schedule and come in and get trained when you can!
- Can I become a lab manager?
   - Heck yes! Once you're trained on all the equipment, we'd be happy to have you be a manager assuming that makes sense.
- Can I use the EPL for a class?
   - Kind of? We don't want you to *require* students to use the lab. the EPL is *not* meant to be a "class lab", like the Capstone lab, or the microwave lab, where students must go to do their lab work. But it *is* a student resource, so encouraging your students to use the lab for their projects is just fine. But we'd much rather have the students making their own decisions: for example, if a commercial PCB is better than a rapid prototyping PCB (which it often is).
- I only want to use *that* machine, can I just have the class come in and use it at some time?
   - If you coordinate it with the lab managers, yes. Please do **not** come in randomly with a class during office hours and expect us to be able to help you. This is true as all of the rapid prototyping tools are, well, fast but not THAT fast. They take time, and it's unlikely we could do anything on any one machine for a whole class in less than an entire day. Or two.
