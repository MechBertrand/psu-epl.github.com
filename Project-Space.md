To gain access you will need a couple of things to get started.  

1. You will need to have an independent project.  This cannot be a class related project, it should be something you want to do in your spare time.  If you need funding for your project you should look at the [Beta Project](https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/the-beta-project)
2. Timeline for your project (ie 6-9 months)
3. Anything extra you might need (monitor, power supply, etc)
4. Email all of these things to lid@pdx.edu

If we have space for you and your project we will let you know when you will have access and you will need to meet with the L.I.D. Program Director to go over rules and requirements.
