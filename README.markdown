### How to update the site:

Edit `index.markdown` to change the wording on the front page.


### Machine Status

Is something broken? Report it! Just edit `_data/machines.yml` and where is
says `up: true` change it to `up: false`, or vise versa. Commit the change
and that's it! The front page will always reflect the status in this file.
