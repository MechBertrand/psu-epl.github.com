# PSU Electronics Prototyping Lab (EPL)
[psu-epl.github.io](http://psu-epl.github.io)  
This repo holds the sources for the EPL website and documentation.

## How to Update the Main Page
Edit `index.md` to change the wording on the front page.

## How to Edit the Documentation
[See the style guide](https://psu-epl.github.io/doc/contributing).

## Machine Status
Is something broken? Report it! Just edit `_data/machines.yml` and where it
says `up: true` change it to `up: false`, or vise versa. Commit the change
and that's it! The front page will always reflect the status in this file.
