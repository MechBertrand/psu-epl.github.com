The RF Chamber is located on the 4th floor of the Engineering Building at PSU (1930 SW 4th Ave.) in room . Here we can help take preliminary measurements before official emc tests are made, measure radiation pattern of antennas, and make acoustic measurement.

Absorbing Cones: There are two types of RF absorbent cones in the lab. The cones on the floor are from Cuming Microwave (PN: [C-RAM SFC-12](https://www.cumingmicrowave.com/pdf/390-Anechoic%20Chamber%20Mat'ls/390-1%20C-RAM%20SFC.pdf)) and the cones on the walls are from ETS-Lindgren (PN:[EHP-12PCL](http://www.ets-lindgren.com/pdf/absorber.pdf)). Minimum specified frequency is 1GHz and reflectivity at 1GHz is -35dB for each type of panel. Although these cones are for RF applications, they are also fairly effective for sound.
