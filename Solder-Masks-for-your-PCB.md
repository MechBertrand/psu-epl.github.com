### SOP

- Turn on the laminator and let it head up.
- Print to PDF from EAGLE -- mirror top, solid, black, 1:1
- Print in Windows from PDF viewer with 1:1 scaling to "Accurip to 1430" printer
- Wear gloves
- Scotchbrite and degrease the copper so the dry film sticks
- Blow out excess water from degreasing so the PCB is dry
- Block off all UV
- Open up dry film and cut out slightly oversized pieces of dry film
- Put away the dry film so it's protected from UV
- Remove the dull protectant layer from the dry film using exacto knife, holding onto the dull film with a piece of blue tape.
- Press down the tacky dry film as you pull away the protectant layer
- Use an exacto knife to cut off the excess film
- Put it through the laminator (the rubber wheels will grip it as you feed it in).
- Turn 90 degrees and put it through again
- If there are bumps, you might want to run it through again. Don't run it through too many times or the film will get too thin
- Put the coated PCB in a dark place to protect it from UV
- Cut the film pattern out with about a 3/4" border
- Tape the 1st pattern on the inside of the glass of the exposure frame, with the ink down (away from the glass, towards the PCB when the frame is closed)
- Put the PCB on a piece of white paper and put that in the exposure frame. 
- Move around the paper in order to align the PCB with the mask
- Close the exposure frame and clip it together.
- Put the exposure frame in the UV curing thing for 2 minutes
- Do the backside if you need to
- Remove protective film using scotch tape 
- Complete dissolve 1/2 tsp of Sodium Carbonate in a 1/2 inch of water in a pyrex pan.
- Soak the board and use a toothbrush to gently abride away the non-exposed pads
- Check the board to make sure all the apertures are exposed
- Bake the board on each side for 3 minutes or more.
