# EPL Soldering and Rework Station

## Policies

- Please use lead based solder only.  If you must use lead free solder, make sure you clean any equipment you used throughly and re-tin tips with leaded solder.

- Keep the area clean.  Pay particular attention to cleaning and tinning soldering iron tips.  They will last longer and you will get better results.

- Always return hand-pieces to their stands when they are not in active use.  They will go to sleep which extends tip life.  It only takes a couple of seconds for the tips to come back up to temperature.

- If you are unsure how to do something, please read the documentation or ask one of the EPL managers.

## Using the equipment

- The station on the right side of the bench currently has an FM-206 three port base unit.  There are two FM-2027 soldering irons, an FM-2027 desoldering tool and an FM-2022 parallel remover tool which can be attached to the base unit.  Note that not all of the ports on the FM-206 are the same.  In particular, the FM-2022 can only run off the the middle port (port 2).
