# EPL Soldering and Rework Station

## Policies

- Please use lead based solder only.  If you must use lead free solder, make sure you clean any equipment you used throughly and re-tin tips with leaded solder.

- Keep the area clean.  Pay particular attention to cleaning and tinning soldering iron tips.  They will last longer and you will get better results.

- Always return hand-pieces to their stands when they are not in active use.  They will go to sleep which extends tip life.  It only takes a couple of seconds for the tips to come back up to temperature.

- If you are unsure how to do something, please read the documentation or ask one of the EPL managers.

## Using the equipment

- The station on the right side of the bench currently has an FM-206 three port base unit.  There are two FM-2027 soldering irons, an FM-2027 desoldering tool and an FM-2022 parallel remover tool which can be attached to the base unit.  Note that not all of the ports on the FM-206 are the same.  In particular, the FM-2022 can only run off the the middle port (port 2).  

- To change settings on any of the ports on the FM-206, hold down the button above the port until you get a menu.  Rotate the knob to make changes and push the knob to make selections.

- It is possible to change the tips on the FR-2027 soldering irons without turning them off and waiting for them to cool down.  However, it takes a bit of care since the tips will be hot.  Press on the two black clips to release the green tip holder.  Then pull the holder and tip off the iron.  Then you can push the tip part way out of the holder by pushing on the cold end (**not** the tip end).  Don't push the tip all the way out.  You want to expose enough of the cold end of the tip to be able to grip it and remove it completely from the holder.  Then put the hot tip in the tip storage holder and install a new tip by pushing it into the tip holder and installing tip and holder onto the iron.

- The center station contains a stereo microscope with illuminator.  If you haven't used a stereo microscope before, here are a few tips:\

 - You don't need to press your eyes onto the eyepieces.  Hold them off slightly.

 - You can use your glasses if you prefer.  Just roll the rubber eyepieces back in that case.

 - Be sure to adjust the separation between the eyepieces to match your eyes.

 - If you are having trouble focusing, first use the normal focus adjustment to focus with your right eye.  Then focus for your left eye by rotating the left eyepiece.

 - Because of the narrow field of view, it is easy to loose track of the position the soldering iron tip when working under the microscope.  Therefore, it is easy to burn yourself or something on your board.  If you can't see the iron tip, take your eyes away from the eyepieces and move the tip into position by looking directly at it.

 - You may be surprised to find how much more precise your hand motions are when working under a microscope.  This seems to be due to enhanced visual feedback.

- The left side station contains a FR-830 board preheater and a FR-803B hot air rework station.  This equipment can remove a chip from a board and also be used to reflow solder chips back on.  The basic procedure is to use the preheater to warm the board from below and then use the FR-803B with its vacuum pickup to heat the solder to melting and pull the chip off.  

 - First fit an appropriate sized rubber tip onto the pickup tool.  Clamp the board under the pickup tool and over the preheater.  Line the pickup tip over the chip you want to extract.

 - Use the preheater to bring the board up to temperature via a gradual heating profile.

 -  Turn on the FR-803B hot air and melt the solder.  Then turn on the vacuum, lower the extraction tip and pull off the chip.

 - Then turn the preheater off and let it go through its cool down cycle before removing the board.
