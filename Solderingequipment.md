# EPL Soldering and Rework Station

## Policies

- Please use lead based solder only.  If you must use lead free solder, make sure you clean any equipment you used throughly and re-tin tips with leaded solder.

- Keep the area clean.  Pay particular attention to cleaning and tinning soldering iron tips.  They will last longer and you will get better results.

- Always return hand-pieces to their stands when they are not in active use.  They will go to sleep which extends tip life.  It only takes a couple of seconds for the tips to come back up to temperature.

- If you are unsure how to do something, please read the documentation or ask one of the EPL managers.
