# About the Ultimaker 2
The Ultimaker 2 3D printer is for printing solid 3D models from digital files. It has a print bed size of 22.3 cm × 22.3 cm × 20.5 cm. It prints only in PLA (Polyactic Acid) filament. 

 # Your STL file
You will need to have your part in .stl  (Stereolithographic) format. Most CAD programs such as Solidworks can export in this format. It is preferable that the part is designed in metric and more specifically millimeters (mm), as Cura is unable to scale between inches and millimeters. 
Some CAD programs offer to export in mm scale even when the part is designed in inches, but this sometimes doesn’t work and the part will appear extremely small on the print bed. To eliminate headaches, design your part in millimeters. 

## Using Cura
Cura (2.7.0) is the software you will use to slice your 3D model(s) into layers and export them as toolpaths. 

#Arranging your part
- Open up Cura. 
- Import your part into Cura using File>Open File
- You can also drag and drop the files into Cura using the file explorer.

- You will need to make sure your part is oriented correctly. Here, the part has overhangs. Since the part will be built from the bottom up, overhangs will make your part anywhere between difficult and impossible to print. Overhangs are depicted in red.

- You can change the part’s orientation by using the toolbox on the left.
