The EasyContac kit from LPKF literally lets you rivet in your plated through holes. This is totally old school: people used to do this decades ago when etching their own boards. Now we do it because we're in a rush :) 

Instead of explaining the whole process, There's a [short and well illustrated online manual](http://www.lpkfusa.com/downloads/support/docs/man_ec.pdf) that you should just read.
