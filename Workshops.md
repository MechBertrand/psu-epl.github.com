## Workshop Schedule:

We're so glad you're interested in taking an EPL (Electronics Prototyping Lab) workshop! 

The EPL hosts Workshop Weekend 3 times per year, during the Fall, Winter, and Spring terms. Our [standalone workshops](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/portland-state-university-electronics-prototyping-lab-epl-11381470478) are about 3 hours long, open to the public, and cover a variety of technology topics that help students succeed at PSU. That makes them a great fit for PSU students interested in technology, high school students preparing for college, and community members or hobbyists! Many people take 3 or 4 workshops over the course of the weekend.

To sign up, visit our [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/portland-state-university-electronics-prototyping-lab-epl-11381470478) and register for your workshop! Each workshop is capped between 10 - 25 participants in order to our teacher to student ratio low and you can sign up for as many as you want, so sign up soon! All workshops will be hosted during the weekend and will either be in the Fourth Avenue Building (1900 SW 4th Ave) or the Engineering Building (1930 SW 4th Ave).
