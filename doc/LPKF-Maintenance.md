LPKF maintenance SOPS

# Changing a bit

- TBD
- Put the used bit in the "bad tool" area or throw it out.
- Close the Lid, check the box next to the tool, and press the "discard tool" to reset durability.
- [Email the managers list](mailto:epl-managers@cecs.pdx.edu) if we get low on that particular tool.

# Maintaining the tool clamp

- Under Help > Help, search for clamp, choose tool clamp maintanence, and watch the video.
- Turn the LPKF and start.
- Edit > Tool Magazine and clear the tool collet of any tool.
   - Click on the cross hair to put away any tool in the collet
   - The head should end up off the board in back (the "idle" position)
- Squeeze off the plastic depth shroud.
- Use cylindrical collet removal tool to unscrew and remove the collet.
- Use the white cleaning tool  to clean out the collet chuck (in the head). Twist it in and out to get in the chuck all the way.
- Under the microscope, use the micro-bottle brush to clean all the gunk out of the collet, both the hole and the slots.
- Clean the white cleaning tool as best you can. Don't get it wet, just wipe it off.
- Put the tiniest dab of lubricate on the white thingy.
  - DO NOT PUT THE LUBRICANT GET ANY WHERE NEAR THE SLITS.
  - Dab the lubricant on the outside shoulder of the collet. 
  - Carefully smooth out the dabs of lubricant on the shoulders into a thin film.
- Put the collet back in, screwing it in finger tight.
- Slip in a tool into the collet, make sure it slides in easily and falls right out. It should be a smooth, mostly frictionless fit.
- You're good to go!

# Changing the tool bar/holder

- Get the Head to the idle position (in the back).
- Unscrew all 10 screws on the top of the tool bar using a Torx 10. You'll need a 1/4 inch wrench as well, in order to get under the camera.
- Pull the hole thing apart, noting position and orientation (especially of the ramp, which has the tall area on left and low area on right).
- Replace the tool holders. They should be symmetrical.
- Screw it down. Tighten, but do NOT over-tighten, the screws
- Turn on the LPKF and put it into service mode.
- Go to Machining > Service > Setup Machine Dialog
- Choose "Step 5: Teach Tool Holder Positions".
   - It should autofocus and find the first tool holder's hole.
   - Choose "Set Current..of first holder"
   - It should go to the last tool holder.
   - Choose "Set Current..of last holder"
   - It'll automatically find all 15 tool holder positions.
   - Choose "Save and close"
- Choose "Step 6: Check Tool Holder Positions"
   - Put in tools in locations 1, 7, 15.
   - Try each holder. NOTE that there is no position "0".
