## CircuitPro is asking me to use a tool we don't have!

Then you have to tell it that we don't have that tool. Makes sense, right? If only it was obvious where to do this.
- Wizards > Equipment Configuration.
- Click on the "Available Tools" entry on the right.
- Uncheck the tool we don't have.

Somehow, this got reset once and all the tools got checked, so CircuitPro was asking for a 2.3 mm bit that we just don't have. Brandon at LPKF pointed us to the above fix.

## My board didn't route correctly!

- TBD

## This machine total sucks, what do I do?

- TBD
