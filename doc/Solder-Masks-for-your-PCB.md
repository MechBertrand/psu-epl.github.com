# Giving your Board Solder Mask

## SOP For ZnO Paste

 - Materials
    - Circuit Specialties dry film solder mask via eBay
    - Laminator
    - ZnO paste UV resist
    - Degreaser (remember, water sticks to the board when it's clean)
    - Sodium Carbonate
    - Glass tray
    - Toothbrush
    - Gloves


 1. Turn on laminator to let it warm up about 30 minutes

#### Making Stencils:

 1. Export just the 

## Work:

 1. Line up stencil on a small board
 1. Spray degreaser on board over the sink and use toothbrush to clean up
 1. Rinse well with water
 1. Dry off really well
 1. _Note: Do the film steps away from floresent lights, in the side room with the lights off if possible_
 1. Cut out a section of mask oversize by a few millimeters
 1. Place film on board
    - Take off adhesive (dull side)
    - Peal off film
    - lay down without wrinkles
 1. Trim off excces
 1. Run through laminator twice, once in each directon
 1. Chuck the board up
 1. line up the stencil
 1. lay on loads of ZnO
 1. squeegy it down
 1. lift stencil
 1. place in UV light for about 2:00 minutes
 1. Let rest for 5:00 minutes


#### Develop

 1. In a tray mixup 1/4 in of hot water and teaspoon on Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
 1. Take board out
 1. Lift off protective film on top
 1. Drop into developer
 1. Swirl for a few seconds (it changes color!)
 1. Use toothbrush to scrape off uncured parts
 1. rinse off everything
 1. Inspect under microscope (at this point you can remove some bits by hand)

#### Harden

 1. Place back in the UV cure for anther 5:00 minutes
 1. **DONE!**

#### Clean up

 1. Dump Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
 1. Put away materials, make sure film is light sealed


## SOP For Inkjet Printer


- Materials
   - Circuit Specialties dry film solder mask via eBay
   - Degreaser (remember, water sticks to the board when it's clean)
   - Hammermill Inkjet Transparency Film

- Equipment you'll need
   - If you're creating inkjet solder mask masks
      - Epson Artisan 1430 $300
      - Accurip printer software $500
      - All black ink system $180 (first time only)
   - Otherwise you'll need a laser cutter, stencil paper, and zinc oxide cream
   - Harbor Freight 9" hot laminator - $30
   - UV System
      - Exposure frame - ? 
      - "Thermal Spa" UV curing for Nails station (off of Amazon)


- Turn on the laminator and let it head up.
- Print to PDF from EAGLE -- mirror top, solid, black, 1:1
- Print in Windows from PDF viewer with 1:1 scaling to "Accurip to 1430" printer
- Wear gloves
- Scotchbrite and degrease the copper so the dry film sticks
- Blow out excess water from degreasing so the PCB is dry
- Block off all UV
- Open up dry film and cut out slightly oversized pieces of dry film
- Put away the dry film so it's protected from UV
- Remove the dull protectant layer from the dry film using exacto knife, holding onto the dull film with a piece of blue tape.
- Press down the tacky dry film as you pull away the protectant layer
- Use an exacto knife to cut off the excess film
- Put it through the laminator (the rubber wheels will grip it as you feed it in).
- Turn 90 degrees and put it through again
- If there are bumps, you might want to run it through again. Don't run it through too many times or the film will get too thin
- Put the coated PCB in a dark place to protect it from UV
- Cut the film pattern out with about a 3/4" border
- Tape the 1st pattern on the inside of the glass of the exposure frame, with the ink down (away from the glass, towards the PCB when the frame is closed)
- Put the PCB on a piece of white paper and put that in the exposure frame. 
- Move around the paper in order to align the PCB with the mask
- Close the exposure frame and clip it together.
- Put the exposure frame in the UV curing thing for 2 minutes
- Do the backside if you need to
- Remove protective film using scotch tape 
- Complete dissolve 1/2 tsp of Sodium Carbonate in a 1/2 inch of water in a pyrex pan.
- Soak the board and use a toothbrush to gently abride away the non-exposed pads
- Check the board to make sure all the apertures are exposed
- Bake the board on each side for 3 minutes or more.
