EPL managers get 24-hour key card access to the EPL, which is fun. 
In exchange, managers help run, maintain, and improve the lab.
There are responsibilities that come with the position, and some hoops to jump through.
*A manager's most important responsibility is to keep people (and equipment) safe.*

# Responsibilities of a Volunteer Manager
1. Train students on machines in the lab
1. Assist students in the student store
1. Put together lab kits or assist in any way, as directed by either the Maintenance director or Store director
1. Sign PSU volunteer paperwork
1. Attend 1 manager meeting a month (meetings are every other week)
1. Tend the lab for at least 2 hours a week 
	- This must be between opening and closing hours (currently 9 AM to 7 PM). 
	- Not required to volunteer during breaks

# How to Become a Manager
1. Send an email to the current EPL administrator (currently Chris) at lid@pdx.edu, establishing yourself as a candidate for manager.
	- This email should include a little info about yourself. 
	- The lab admin will then send you an application to fill out. 
	- The date 30 days after the application is filled out will be your start date. 
1. Get trained on all the equipment that's currently being used in the lab and all the store operations. 
	- You have approximately 30 days from your application date to finish your training.
	- It's okay to get trained on all the equipment *before* applying. You won't need to re-train.
1. Wait to be reviewed by the existing managers.  
	The admin will email the current manager group and let everyone know you're about to become a new manager. 
	Any current manager can veto someone trying to become a manager. 
	This may sound arbitrary, but it's not. 
	It's to prevent people who aren't good with other people or with equipment from becoming managers. 
	Becoming a manager is a big responsibility and means keeping people safe, being responsible, and contributing to the community. 
	Some people just aren't ready for that yet.
1. Finally, once all this happens, the admin will meet with you and go over becoming a manager (takes about an hour).
1. After 6 months you can apply to become a paid manager. The instructions to do this are [on the private manager's wiki.](https://github.com/psu-epl/epl-managers-private/wiki/Getting-paid-as-a-Student-Manager) 

The vast majority of active managers are PSU students. 
It's possible -- but also rare -- to become a manager if you aren't enrolled, and depends on the opinion of the lab administrator.
