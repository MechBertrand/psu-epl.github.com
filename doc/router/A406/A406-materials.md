Materials needed for the **AccurateCNC A406 PCB router**.

# Bits

Note that you MUST ask Think and Tinker to "ring" these bits for the A406.

# Tool Settings

Notes:

- New Tools can be added from ATC Control Panel in CNC mode.  Global/Default settings can be set in CAM mode under "Setup."
- [Tool Settings Tutorial/Info](http://precisebits.com/tutorials/pcb_mech_etch.htm)
- V-Tip Max Plunge rate is 25 IPM  


## Drills

Notes:

- Buy these in packs of 5.
- We don't need bigger than 0.8 mm because the A406 will use the 0.8mm router to make all holes bigger

Bits:

- 0.35 mm = DC208-M035-023D (used for Nystrom vias and for 0.40 mm drills as well)
- 0.5 mm = DC208-M050-036D
- 0.6 mm = DC208-M060-034D
- 0.7 mm = DC208-M070-040D 
- 0.8 mm = DC208-M080-040D

## Contour Router bits

Notes:

- These route out the boards from the stock. T&T calls them "Chip-breaker Router Bits".
- Buy these in packs of 5.

Bits:

- 0.8 mm = RCC08-0315-020FC
- 1.0 mm = RCC08-0394-026F

## Isolation milling bits

Notes:

- These isolate traces on the PCB. T*T calls them "2-flute Engravers".
- Buy these in packs of 5.

Bits:

- 60 degree = EM2E8-0625-60V

## End Mills

Notes:

- These remove large swathes of copper. T&T calls them "2-flute stub end mills".
- Buy them in packs of 5.
- Link: <http://precisebits.com/products/carbidebits/precisebit-stub.asp>

Bits:

- 0.8 mm = MN208-0313-006F
- 1.6 mm = MN208-0625-009F
- 2.0 mm = MN208-0787-020F
- 3.0 mm = MN208-1181-022F

# Backing material

- MDF, TBD
