# How Pricing Works
Students and staff pay reduced prices with no general lab use fee.
Non-students/staff pay the regular prices in addition to a lab use fee (day pass).
Feel free to use the lab and pay at the end of your work for the day so you can pay for everything all at once.

We charge small fees for using the machines to help pay for the consumables and maintenance of the lab.
