## The PSU Electronics Prototyping Lab (EPL)

![The EPL](/images/lab_panorama.png)

The EPL is a lab for rapidly prototyping electronics projects. It is meant for
students (and eventually community members) to be able to walk in with an idea
and CAD files and walk out with a fully functioning piece of electronics in an
enclosure. **[Watch an introductory video on the lab](http://youtu.be/P7JFAv6JM00 "YouTube")**.
