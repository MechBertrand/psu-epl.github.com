The EPL is primarily an electronics prototyping lab. That means we are
focused on helping people rapid prototype electronic projects. That 
includes front panels, covers, holders and boxes for your project!
That's why we have a laser. We don't expect perfect things or production
level use from it.


## Materials

The materials we can cut or engrave are:

### Acylic (PMMA)

Sometimes brand named 'Plexiglas' we can cut up to 1/2 inch thick acylic.

We stock some 1/16, 1/8, and 3/16 inch clear sheets that are availible
to purchase for projects.

Acylic is the prefered material to use in laser cutter. It cuts very
cleanly and leaves polished edges. It can be engraved as well which is
perfect for lettering and logoing.

### Cardboard and Paper

Any paper or cardboard (even corrigated!) cuts very quickly and nicely
which makes it perfect for testing a design.

### Plywood

We stock 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch laminated bamboo plywood in the lab. We
can also cut similar thickness hardwood.

### Anodized Aluminium (mark only)

While we can't cut metal, the laser can mark the surface of dark anodized
aluminium. This lookes especially good as lettering or drawing on 
black anodied aluminimum plates. Perfect for front panels!

## Materials We DON'T Cut

Due to fumes or laser power we can't cut:

 - PCB's (FR4)
 - Carbon Fiber
 - PVC
 - Vinyl
 - Polycarbonate (Lexan)
 - Metal
